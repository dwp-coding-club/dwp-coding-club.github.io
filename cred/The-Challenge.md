Here’s the problem statement:
The generosity of people in a community is often unacknowledged, and over time can be a disincentive to further generosity. Your challenge is to design and build a system called “Accolade” that supports better acknowledgement through visible, tangible acknowledgements from any person to another.

Use cases (in rough order of priority): your choice how many to do!

As a community member I want to

   Sign  up using email verification
   Give an accolade to someone specifying their email address, acknowledgement text and optional list of additional cc email addresses
   Be notified of an accolade being given to me even if I’ve not signed up to  the service yet
   View the accolade as a visually attractive, printable certificate
   View all accolades sent
   View all accolades received
   View recent accolades sent by others in the community
   Select someone to give an accolade to by searching for them in ActiveDirectory


As a line manager I want to

   Receive accolades delivered to direct report
